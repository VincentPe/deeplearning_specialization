# Deeplearning specialization
Coursera deep learning specialization taught by Andrew Ng. Four courses from the math behind neural networks, 
how to set them up in keras/Python, how to program them yourself using Numpy, how to tune them well,
and how to use e.g. convolutional or recurrent architectures for specific deep learning tasks.
